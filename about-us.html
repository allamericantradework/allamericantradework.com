          <h2 class="text-center">House Painters</h2>
          Here at All American Trade Work our house painters are truly one of a kind.  Our house painters are trained on quality of work as well as getting the job done in a timely manner.  This is really a one of a kind trait that is hard to find.  All of our house painters are directly employed by the company, we don't sub contract any of our work.  This ensures that all jobs are warrantied and ensured through the company and not a third party.
          <br><br>Consistency with our house painters and our customers is also very important.  We try to make our customers as comfortable and familiar as possible by making sure we send the same painters to a job site if multiple jobs are to be done at the same location.  It can be very difficult sometimes to ensure all of your needs get met when it comes to painting.  You may think that you are being "too picky" or that the little details don't matter.  Well to us THEY DO!  That is why we construct a punch list after the completion of every job and do a thorough walk through with the customers to make sure all needs are met.
          <br><br>Our team of painters is bound to impress you and if you're not satisfied... we're not satisfied.
