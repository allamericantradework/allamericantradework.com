          <em>"Zach did an excellent job of painting the walls in our living, dining and kitchen area. We highly recommend him. He works alone and does a thorough job leaving no mess behind. We were surprised how quickly he finished the job giving two coats of paint to all surfaces. He worked steadily and methodically for much of the day. He was pleasant to work with. His quote for the job was well below the competition. We are very satisfied customers and give Zach five stars in each of the Home Advisor categories. Furthermore, we were delighted to discover the Home Adviser app. It worked very well for us both in finding Zack and finding an electrician to do another job. We will use Home Advisor again in the future and recommended it to our neighbors and friends."</em>

          <em>"Zach was very polite and professional. He showed up when he said he would or would call if he was going to be delayed. He and Darren were thorough and efficient. They noticed flaws in the already painted areas and offered to repaint the areas for a very reasonable price. They painted doors and installed the door knobs, fixed drywall, detailed the ceiling and fixed drywall and painted the garage. They were very considerate of our home and belongings. We will be using them again."</em>

          <em>"My living room has been completely transformed! All American Trade Work was great to work with! They redid our wall surrounding our fireplace and they did built in cabinets and ship lap above with crown molding. They did some electrical work for our tv and components. They made my vision a reality! Zach was ALWAYS on time, and for a busy lady as myself, I really appreciated that! He was very professional, trust worthy, and efficient. He would stop at nothing to get the job done! :) He was so happy and willing to listen to my ideas and thoughts. Now, everyone that walks in my house, stops and says, "WOW, that looks amazing and completely well done!" I will refer him to EVERYONE I know!"</em>
